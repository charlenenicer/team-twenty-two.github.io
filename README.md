# Green Travel


GreenTravel is a web-app for users who take public transit, bike or walk to participate challenges, get rewards and make an impact on the environment. 
The app will integrate with public transpiration system or fitness tracking app e.g. TranLink to get usersâ€™ travel hours. When users add their compass card on the app, they will earn points based on the travel time. They can redeem these points to get discounts or a product. At the same time, users can invite their friends to participate in difference challenges for fun. Everyone can see their points and rankings in the community to stay motivate and get more rewards.  The ranking is based on the points. Higher the points a user has, higher ranking he/she will get. Lastly, they can see the percentage of less carbon footprint they produce in their daily lives.  Register an account to play, reward and make an impact on your daily travel.
